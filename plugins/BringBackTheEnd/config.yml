#
# Bring Back The End Configuration File
#
# Description of the options:
# logDebug (true/false) - Logs debug messages to console
# autoReset (true/false) - Activates the auto reset functionality of the plugin
# interval <time> - How long, in seconds, before resetting after killing the dragon(s)
# tpPlayersAfterTimeout (true/false) - After the grace period (interval), tp the players that are in the end to spawn (true) or
#   wait until they leave (false). 
# dragonAmount - How many dragons should spawn.
# saveRate <time> How often (in seconds) to save the remaining ticks for a reset to this configuration file.
#   NOTES: 
#      * Too low means increased disk access.
#      * Too high may cause the current tick count to be lost if the server is shut down incorrectly.
#      * Default is 5 minutes.
#      * This value needs to be lower than the interval or it will be adjusted as necessary.
#
#  autoHookWorld: Looks for all worlds and hooks to the first 'end' environment found. If set to false, you need to use the 'worldName' property
#

# DO NOT CHANGE THE REMANING OPTION UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON
